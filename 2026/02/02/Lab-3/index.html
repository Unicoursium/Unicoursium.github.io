<p>We have adjusted the voltage to 1.8v, but received 1.6871v, so we think maybe it’s because the bulb is not prepared. so we’ve changed the pause(1); to pause(3); and we get 1.7643v.  </p>
<h2 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a><strong>Method</strong></h2><p>The Bulb Board was driven using a DC voltage generated by the DAC on the PyBench board and controlled via MATLAB.<br>For each input voltage xdc​, the system was allowed to settle for 0.5 s to ensure that transient effects had decayed and that the output had reached steady state.</p>
<p>The output voltage ydc​, corresponding to the light intensity measured by the phototransistor and amplifier, was then sampled multiple times and averaged to reduce noise.<br>This procedure was repeated over a range of input voltages between 0 V and approximately 2.5 V, and the resulting DC input–output characteristic was plotted.</p>
<h2 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>The measured DC input–output characteristic is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For low input voltages (below approximately <strong>0.5</strong>), the output voltage remains close to zero and the light bulb does not emit visible light.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the mid-range of input voltage (approximately <strong>0.7-1.6</strong>), the output increases rapidly with input voltage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At higher input voltages (above approximately <strong>1.6V</strong>), the output voltage saturates at around <strong>2.1V</strong>, and further increases in input voltage produce little change in output.</p>
</li>

<p>A sinusoidal input signal was generated using the DAC on the PyBench board and controlled via MATLAB.<br>For each test frequency, the output voltage corresponding to the measured light intensity was sampled at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz, and a sufficient number of samples were collected to capture steady-state behaviour.</p>
<p>The system gain at each frequency was calculated using the ratio of the output peak-to-peak voltage to the input peak-to-peak voltage:</p>
<p>∣G(jω)∣&#x3D;xpp​ypp​​</p>
<p>The gain was then converted to decibels using:</p>
<p>GdB​&#x3D;20log10​∣G(jω)∣</p>
<p>Measurements were initially performed at selected frequencies (1 Hz, 3 Hz, 4 Hz, 5 Hz, 7 Hz and 9 Hz), and subsequently automated to obtain measurements over the frequency range 1–20 Hz in steps of 1 Hz.</p>
<h2 id="Results-1"><a href="#Results-1" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>The measured frequency response shows the following trends:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At low frequencies, the measured gain remains approximately constant, indicating that the output closely follows the input signal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A peak in gain is observed at approximately <strong>4hz and 5hz</strong>, corresponding to resonant behaviour of the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At higher frequencies, the gain decreases rapidly, indicating significant attenuation of high-frequency input signals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="/2026/02/02/Lab-3/l3t31.png" class="" title="a">

<p>When compared with the theoretical frequency response obtained in Task 2, the overall shape of the measured response is similar, including the presence of a resonant peak and high-frequency roll-off. However, discrepancies in gain magnitude and peak sharpness are observed.</p>
<h1 id="Task-3a"><a href="#Task-3a" class="headerlink" title="Task 3a"></a>Task 3a</h1><h2 id="Method-2"><a href="#Method-2" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a><strong>Method</strong></h2><p>An automated MATLAB script was developed to measure the system gain at frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 20 Hz in steps of 1 Hz.<br>At each frequency, a small-amplitude sinusoidal input signal was applied, with the operating point constrained between 1.45 V and 1.55 V to ensure approximately linear system behaviour.</p>
<p>For each frequency, the output signal was sampled at a fixed sampling frequency and the steady-state portion of the signal was analysed.<br>The system gain was calculated using the ratio of output to input peak-to-peak amplitudes and converted to decibels.<br>The measured gain values were then plotted as a function of frequency to obtain the experimental frequency response of the system.</p>
<h2 id="Results-2"><a href="#Results-2" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>The measured frequency response obtained from the automated sweep shows a clear resonant peak and a gradual roll-off at higher frequencies.<br>The overall shape of the experimental frequency response closely resembles the theoretical prediction from Task 2.</p>
<p>However, differences are observed in the magnitude of the gain and the sharpness of the resonant peak. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The measured peak gain is lower than the theoretical value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The resonant peak appears broader and less pronounced than predicted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>High-frequency attenuation is stronger in the measured response.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The output voltage, corresponding to the measured light intensity, was sampled at a fixed sampling frequency, and the transient response was recorded over a sufficient duration to capture the full system response, including oscillations and settling behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="Results-3"><a href="#Results-3" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>The measured step response exhibits clear transient dynamics.</p>
<p>Following the rising step input, the output voltage increases rapidly and overshoots the final steady-state value before undergoing oscillations that gradually decay with time.<br>A similar oscillatory behaviour is observed following the falling step, although the amplitude and shape of the response differ slightly due to the asymmetric behaviour of the physical system.</p>
<p>After the transient oscillations decay, the output settles to a steady-state value consistent with the DC characteristic obtained in Task 1.</p>
